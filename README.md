# @zenithbuild/cli ⚡

The command-line interface for developing and building Zenith applications.

## Overview

## Features

- **Dev Server**: Instant HMR (Hot Module Replacement) powered by Bun.
- **Build System**: optimized production bundling.
- **Plugin Management**: Easily add and remove Zenith plugins.
- **Preview**: Test your production builds locally.

## Commands

### `zenith dev`
Starts the development server on `localhost:3000`.

### `zenith build`

### `zenith preview`
Serves the locally built application for verification.

### `zenith add <plugin>`
Installs and configures a Zenith plugin.
